    "Traditional Web Hosting: In traditional hosting, your website or application is hosted on a single physical server. Resources like CPU, RAM, and storage are dedicated to your site.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Scaling in traditional hosting usually requires upgrading to a more powerful server or adding more servers, which can lead to downtime during the migration process.\n",

    "Traditional Web Hosting: Traditional hosting often involves fixed costs, where you pay a consistent fee for the resources regardless of whether you fully utilize them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Resources are fixed and limited to the capacity of the physical server. You might face performance issues during traffic spikes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Reliability might be limited to the capabilities of the single server. Downtime can occur if the server experiences hardware failures.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting offers higher redundancy and reliability. Data is often replicated across multiple servers and data centers, reducing the risk of downtime."
